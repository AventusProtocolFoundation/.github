Aventus repositories have moved.

As part of the transition to **AventusDAO** and a unified, decentralised governance framework, all actively maintained Aventus repositories have been migrated to a new GitHub organisation.
You can find the latest code, issues, and releases here: https://github.com/AventusDAO.

This organisation (including its repositories) is now considered **legacy** and is retained for historical reference only:
 - No new features, fixes, or security patches will be published here
 - All new development happens under the **AventusDAO** organisation
 - If you’re looking for a specific project, start with the repos under aventus-dao
   
Please update any bookmarks, scripts, or integrations that point to this organisation to use the new **AventusDAO** URLs instead.
